\subsection{Summary and Comparison with MER Cameras}
To validate the coherence of the characteristics of the designed camera, a comparative table \ref{tabCameras} with the MER cameras Navcam (Navigation Camera) and Pancam (Panoramic Camera) \cite{merengineeringcameras} can be found below.

The CCD parameters are similar except for the spectral range. As Pancam mission is to investigate Mars terrain and obtain color images of any information useful to learn more about the Red Planet, that seems logical that the spectrum is wider than the one we choose. The navigation camera provides a 360$\degree$ view of the area where is located the rover. The spectrum was reduced using filters to allow a higher spectral responsivity.
For the optical features, it can be noticed that the parameters have approximately the same size. The depth of field for our camera is restricted but it is due to our aim: stabilising the camera in front of a rock and carrying out its depth map.
We can conclude that since the MER cameras accomplish well their task, the designed camera which is comparable to them should also be capable of acquiring good images on Mars.
