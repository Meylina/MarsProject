First of all, the irradiance $F$ of the light from the sun falling on the surface of Mars can be calculated as following :
Conservation of energy :
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:conservation of energy}
4\pi R_\odot^2F_\odot=4\pi R^2F
\end{equation}
with 

$R_\odot=6,956.10^5\ m$ : solar radius

$F_\odot=6,45.10^7\ W.m^{-2}$ : energy flow of the surface of the sun

$R = 2,27936.10^11 \ m$ : distance Mars-Sun

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Irradiance Sun}
F = F_\odot \left(\frac{R_\odot}{R}\right)^2 = 589 \ W/m^2
\end{equation}

Moreover, we can assume that a part of the irradiance is absorbed by the atmosphere. Knowing that the atmosphere of Earth absorbs and scatters to space around 30\% of the incident irradiance of the Sun, and knowing  that the atmosphere of Mars is thinner than the one of the Earth, we will postulate that 10\% of the incident irradiance is absorbed.
